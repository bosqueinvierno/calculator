# CalculatorX
CalculatorX is a basic online calculator that should do your basic calculations, from `adding` to `substracting`, from `multiplying` to `dividing`, from `squaring` to taking a `square root`.

You can view the calculator and play around with it:

## What I used: 
* HTML5 (Duh!)
* CSS3 (Rly?)
* Bootstrap 3 (Hmmm...)
* jQuery (Nahh!!)
* JavaScript (No way!!)

## Material Design Feel
I wanted this calculator to be a pleasant experience for the user. So I decided to use my CSS and Bootstrap skills to make it look like a Material Design Calculator. I believe that I did a decent job for achieving that.

## Inspired by FreeCodeCamp
This was one of the [Zipline Challenges in FreeCodeCamp](http://goo.gl/FTaKBM).<br /> 
FreeCodeCamp is a great tool for beginner like me who's trying to learn JavaScript. I'm trying to build these small projects to learn and understand JavaScript.
